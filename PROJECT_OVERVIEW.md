# 🛰️ Sentra — The Real-Time Deployment Intelligence Platform

## 💡 What Is Sentra?

**Sentra** is a **self-hosted, real-time deployment intelligence platform** that continuously monitors, analyzes, and controls software rollouts.

It integrates **metrics (Prometheus)**, **logs (Loki)**, and **traces (Tempo)** into a single real-time decision engine —  
allowing deployments to automatically **pause, rollback, or promote** based on live telemetry.

In short:  
> Sentra transforms observability from passive monitoring into **active, intelligent deployment control**.

## ⚙️ The Problem

Modern CI/CD systems (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD) deploy code — but they’re **blind** to what happens after.

- Deployments fail silently in production.  
- Metrics and logs are viewed only *after* user-impact.  
- Rollbacks are manual, slow, and error-prone.  
- “Zero downtime” is still wishful thinking.

The result:  
Downtime, lost revenue, and slower release velocity — especially at scale.

## 🚀 The Solution

Sentra introduces a **closed-loop feedback system** between deployments and observability:

| Step | Action |
|------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | Rollout begins (e.g. 5% traffic). |
| 2️⃣ | Sentra collects real-time telemetry (metrics, logs, traces). |
| 3️⃣ | Every few seconds, SLO gates are evaluated. |
| 4️⃣ | Healthy → promote rollout (15%, 30%, 50%). |
| 5️⃣ | Degraded → pause or rollback automatically. |

This creates a **self-correcting deployment process** — eliminating downtime and reducing manual intervention.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

| Problem | Traditional Tools | Sentra |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Monitoring | Reactive | Proactive & automatic |
| Rollback | Manual | Instant, autonomous |
| Observability | Disconnected | Unified (metrics + logs + traces) |
| Deployment safety | Guesswork | Data-driven, real-time |
| Hosting | Cloud vendor lock-in | 100% self-hosted |

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

**Core Components**
- **Go Rollout Controller:** Evaluates telemetry, drives rollout decisions.
- **Node.js API:** REST + WebSocket for integration and UI.
- **Next.js Dashboard:** Live rollout analytics and controls.
- **MySQL:** Stores rollout state, policies, and audit history.
- **Redis:** Pub/sub for real-time state propagation.
- **Prometheus / Loki / Tempo:** Observability data sources.
- **Python FastAPI (future):** ML-based predictive rollback & SLO optimization.

**Telemetry loop latency:** ~2–5 seconds from data ingestion to decision.

## 📊 Impact

| Metric | Before Sentra | After Sentra |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Rollout failure detection | Minutes | Seconds |
| Downtime duration | High (manual rollback) | Near-zero |
| Deployment safety | Manual monitoring | Automated SLO enforcement |
| Release velocity | Slower (risk-averse) | Continuous, safe |
| Developer load | Reactive firefighting | Observability-driven automation |

## 🧭 Vision

> **“Observability that acts.”**  
> Sentra is building the first **deployment-aware observability system** —  
> unifying telemetry, intelligence, and automation to make **zero-downtime deployments the default**.
