🚀 Sentra — Real-Time Multi-Cloud Deployment Intelligence

Sentra is a self-hosted, real-time deployment intelligence platform that makes software rollouts autonomous, safe, and zero-downtime.
It continuously analyzes live telemetry (metrics, logs, traces) from Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo — automatically deciding whether to promote, pause, or rollback deployments in seconds.

Sentra integrates seamlessly with AWS, Azure, and GCP, managing canaries across Kubernetes, Serverless, and container environments through adaptive control adapters.

Designed for multi-cloud scale, Sentra combines a Go-based controller, Node.js API, and Next.js real-time frontend with MySQL + Redis and a 2–5s telemetry feedback loop — turning observability into action.

Core Value:

“Sentra transforms deployments from reactive to intelligent — where observability drives decisions, not dashboards.”

Highlights:

🔁 Real-time, telemetry-driven rollout governance

☁️ Native multi-cloud (AWS / Azure / GCP / Hybrid)

⚙️ Auto rollback, canary promotion, pause/resume

🧠 ML-ready (predictive anomaly detection)

🧩 Extensible adapters for Kubernetes, Lambda, Cloud Run, ECS, Functions

🔒 Fully self-hosted, secure, and data-resident
