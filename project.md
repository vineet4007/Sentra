# 🛰️ Sentra — Real-Time Deployment Intelligence Platform

> **Zero downtime. Zero guesswork. Real-time deployment awareness.**  
> Sentra makes your deployments *observable, intelligent, and self-healing.*

## 💡 The Idea

Modern software is deployed faster than it’s understood.  
Every organization wants continuous deployment — but in reality:
- Rollouts still break in production.
- Monitoring only *alerts after users suffer*.
- Rollbacks are slow and manual.
- “Zero downtime” remains a buzzword, not a guarantee.

**Sentra** changes that.

It’s a **self-hosted, deployment-aware observability system** that **connects deployments with live telemetry** —  
**metrics, logs, and traces** — and reacts in real-time.  
When Sentra detects anomalies, it can **pause**, **rollback**, or **promote** automatically.

In short:
> Sentra makes deployments *aware of reality* — and smart enough to act.

## ⚙️ The Real-World Problem

| Pain Point | What Happens Today | Result |
|-------------|--------------------|---------|
| **Deployments are blind** | CI/CD pushes to prod without knowing what’s happening | Undetected regressions |
| **Observability is reactive** | Prometheus/Grafana show problems *after* users are affected | Slow reaction time |
| **Humans are the bottleneck** | Engineers manually monitor and rollback | Downtime, fatigue |
| **Canary deployments are guesswork** | “Ship 10%, wait, hope for the best” | High release risk |

The result:  
- Lost revenue from downtime.  
- Burned DevOps teams.  
- Slower release cycles because “safe” means “manual.”

## 🧩 Sentra’s Solution

Sentra introduces a **feedback loop** between deployments and observability.

Instead of “deploy → wait → react,”  
Sentra continuously **observes → evaluates → acts**.

### 🔁 How It Works
1. Deploy version `v2.3.0` to 5% of users.
2. Sentra collects real-time telemetry:
   - **Metrics (Prometheus)** — error rates, latency, CPU, memory.
   - **Logs (Loki)** — error spikes, patterns, anomalies.
   - **Traces (Tempo)** — distributed latency, failed spans.
3. Every few seconds, Sentra evaluates SLO gates:
   - `error_rate ≤ 1%`
   - `p95_latency ≤ 400ms`
   - `log_error_ratio ≤ 0.5%`
4. If everything looks healthy → promote rollout to 15%, then 30%, then 50%.
5. If an anomaly appears → automatically **pause** or **rollback**.

Everything is visible live through the **Next.js dashboard** — no page refresh, no manual checking.

## 🧠 Why Sentra Matters

### ⚡ Real-time awareness, not postmortems
You see — and react to — issues *as they happen*, not after your users complain.

### 🤖 Autonomous recovery
Sentra pauses or rolls back deployments automatically when thresholds breach.

### 🧩 Unified visibility
One pane of glass for metrics, logs, traces, and rollout states — fully correlated.

### 🔒 Self-hosted and private
No cloud vendor lock-in, no data sharing, no “SaaS tax.”  
Everything runs inside your infra.

### 📈 Deploy faster, safer
Sentra combines velocity with reliability — so teams deploy continuously *without fear.*

## 📡 Real-Time Behavior

- Telemetry evaluated every **2–5 seconds**
- **Prometheus:** metrics (error rates, latency, CPU/memory)
- **Loki:** logs (error patterns, anomaly ratios)
- **Tempo:** traces (distributed latency and failure correlation)
- **Sliding evaluation window** ensures stable promotion
- **Redis pub/sub** streams live rollout states to the **Next.js frontend**
- **Latency target:** <5 seconds from telemetry → decision → UI update

## 🧠 The Vision

> “Observability without action is just noise.  
> Sentra makes observability *actionable*.”

Sentra’s mission is to **merge CI/CD and Observability** into a single, intelligent system  
that ensures **zero-downtime, self-healing deployments** — driven by real-time telemetry.
